we are building a huge system, with lots of parts in ~/github/sness23/sales* 

for this part we want to build out our immutable message log

i have a crazy idea 

to do it like some kind of blockchain

or something

so that it is immutable by default

like immutable by design

it has to be very inexpensive to add entries

it has to be very inexpensive to read entries

we could have like a hash or something that is calculated?

what is the smart thing to do here?

this must be something that is already done

is there a library we can use? 

hopefully usable in node

lets write a cli program that i can type in 

and it will add things to this immutable log file
